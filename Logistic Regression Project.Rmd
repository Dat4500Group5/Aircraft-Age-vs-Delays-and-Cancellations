### Cubic Model (best)
```{r cubic model}
m3 <- glm(COUNT_CARRIER_DELAY_30_RATIO ~ AGE + I(AGE^2) + I(AGE^3), 
          data = Ratios_2, 
          family = binomial)
summary(m3)
```
### Plotting cubic model Age vs Delay30
```{r cubic model plot}
# real data 
plot(age_means$AGE, age_means$COUNT_CARRIER_DELAY_30_RATIO,
     xlab = "Age of Aircraft (years)",
     ylab = "Proportion Delayed 30 mins",
     pch = 16, col = "blue",
     main = "Observed Data with Cubic Model")

# Sequence of ages for smooth prediction curves
age_seq <- seq(min(age_means$AGE), max(age_means$AGE), length.out = 200)

# Cubic model predictions
coefs3 <- coef(m3)
logits3 <- coefs3["(Intercept)"] + 
           coefs3["AGE"] * age_seq + 
           coefs3["I(AGE^2)"] * age_seq^2 + 
           coefs3["I(AGE^3)"] * age_seq^3
probs3 <- exp(logits3) / (1 + exp(logits3))


lines(age_seq, probs3, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

<!-- ### Quartic Model -->
<!-- ```{r quartic model} -->

<!--           data = Ratios_2, family = binomial) -->
<!-- summary(m4) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Plotting Quartic Model -->
<!-- there is no significant difference between the quartic model graph and the cubic model graph -->

### Linear model for Age vs Cancellations
```{r cubic model cancellations}
m1.5 <- glm(Proportion_Cancelled ~ AGE, data = Ratios_2, family = binomial)
summary(m1.5)
```

### Linear model plot for age vs cancellations 
The real values do seem to follow a linear pattern.
These predicted probabilities are very small (between 0.013% and 0.13%).
The prediction curve is basically flat.
The model sees almost no meaningful relationship between aircraft age and cancellation rate
``` {r cubic model for cancellations plot}
# Plot the observed data
plot(age_means$AGE, age_means$Proportion_Cancelled,
     xlab = "Age of Aircraft (years)",
     ylab = "Proportion Cancelled",
     pch = 16, col = "blue",
     main = "Observed Data with Linear Regression Model")

# Sequence of ages for smooth prediction curves
age_seq <- seq(min(age_means$AGE), max(age_means$AGE), length.out = 200)

# Linear model predictions
coefs1.5 <- coef(m1.5)
logits1.5 <- coefs1.5["(Intercept)"] + coefs1.5["AGE"] * age_seq
probs1.5 <- exp(logits1.5) / (1 + exp(logits1.5))

# Add model prediction line for m1
lines(age_seq, probs1.5, col = "red", lwd = 2)

# Add horizontal dashed line at mean observed proportion delayed
abline(h = mean(age_means$Proportion_Cancelled), col = "gray", lty = 2)

# printing the probability to explain why the line is flat
range(probs1.5)
```
