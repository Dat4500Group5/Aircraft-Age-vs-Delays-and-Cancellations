What proportion of flights are more than 30 minutes late?

### Importing the data
```{r data importing}
aircrafts_ages_raw <- read.csv("SKYS_THE_LIMIT.csv")
```

### Wrangling the data
narrow the data to a subset of flights that are delayed by more than 30 mins.
```{r data wrangling}

#separate into ages (group by and summarize)
aircrafts_ages_since_2003 <- aircrafts_ages_raw |>
  filter(AGE <= 22) |>
  mutate(
    flights_bin = cut(
      FLIGHTS,
      breaks = c(0, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 25000, 50000, 75000),
      labels = c("0–100", "101–500", "501–1K", "1K–5K", "5K–10K", "10K–25K", "25K–50K", "50K–75K"),
      include.lowest = TRUE
    )
  )


delay_by_age <- aircrafts_ages_since_2003 |>
  group_by(flights_bin) |>
  summarize(
    total_aircraft = n(),
    num_delayed = sum(TOT_CARRIER_DELAY > 30, na.rm = TRUE),
    proportion_delayed = num_delayed / total_aircraft
  )


View(delay_by_age)
```

### First Visualization
```{r first visualization}
ggplot(delay_by_age, aes(x = flights_bin, y = proportion_delayed*100, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(color = "thistle3") +
  geom_point(color = "darkblue", size = 3) +
  labs(
    title = "Percentage of Aircraft Delayed >30 mins by Number of Flights",
    x = "Aircraft Age (total flights)",
    y = "Percentage Delayed"
  ) 

```
